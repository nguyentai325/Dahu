In this project, I want to present the Dahu distance and its applications for example 
salient object detection, interactive segmentation and shortest path finding.
This new distance is belong to the mathematical morphology domain.
The project is implemented based on OLENA platform, which used C++.
For more information about this distance, you can read in these papers:
